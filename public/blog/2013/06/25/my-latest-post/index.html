<div class="entry-content"><h3>Economy</h3>

<p>In this first and longest chapter, Thoreau outlines his project: a two-year, two-month, and two-day stay at a cozy, &ldquo;tightly shingled and plastered,&rdquo; English-style 10&#8217; × 15&#8217; cottage in the woods near Walden Pond. He does this, he says, to illustrate the spiritual benefits of a simplified lifestyle. He easily supplies the four necessities of life (food, shelter, clothing, and fuel) with the help of family and friends, particularly his mother, his best friend, and Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Waldo Emerson. The latter provided Thoreau with a work exchange – he could build a small house and plant a garden if he cleared some land on the woodlot and did other chores while there. Thoreau meticulously records his expenditures and earnings, demonstrating his understanding of &ldquo;economy,&rdquo; as he builds his house and buys and grows food. For a home and freedom, he spent a mere $28.12½, in 1845 (about $863 in today&rsquo;s money). At the end of this chapter, Thoreau inserts a poem, &ldquo;The Pretensions of Poverty,&rdquo; by seventeenth-century English poet Thomas Carew. The poem criticizes those who think that their poverty gives them unearned moral and intellectual superiority. The chapter is filled with figures of practical advice, facts, big ideas about individualism versus social existence&hellip;manifesto of social thought and meditations on domestic management. Much attention is devoted to the skepticism and wonderment with which townspeople greeted both him and his project as he tries to protect his views from those of the townspeople who seem to view society as the only place to live. He recounts the reasons for his move to Walden Pond along with detailed steps back to the construction of his new home (methods, support, etc.).</p>

<h3>Where I Lived, and What I Lived For</h3>

<p>Thoreau recollects thoughts of places he stayed at before selecting Walden Pond. Quotes Roman Philosopher Cato&rsquo;s advice &ldquo;consider buying a farm very carefully before signing the papers.&rdquo;[5] His possibilities included a nearby Hollowell farm (where the wife unexpectedly decided she wanted to keep the farm. Thoreau takes to the woods dreaming of an existence free of obligations and full of leisure. He announces that he resides far from social relationships that mail represents (post office) and the majority of the chapter focuses on how/his thoughts while constructing and living in his new home.</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p>Thoreau discusses the benefits of classical literature (preferably in the original Greek or Latin), and bemoans the lack of sophistication in Concord, evident in the popularity of unsophisticated literature. He also loved to read books by world travelers. He yearns for a utopian time when each New England village supports &ldquo;wise men&rdquo; to educate and thereby ennoble the population.</p>

<h3>Sounds</h3>

<p>Thoreau opens this chapter by warning against relying too much on literature as a means of transcendence. Instead, one should experience life for oneself. Thus, after describing his house&rsquo;s beautiful natural surroundings and his casual housekeeping habits, Thoreau goes on to criticize the train whistle that interrupts his reverie. To him, the railroad symbolizes the destruction of the pastoral way of life. Following is a description of the sounds audible from his cabin: the church bells ringing, carriages rattling and rumbling, cows lowing, whip-poor-wills singing, owls hooting, frogs croaking, and cockerels crowing.
Solitude: The chapter focuses on his feeling of solitude and its amazing feeling. He explains how loneliness can occur even amid companions if one&rsquo;s heart is not open to them. Thoreau meditates on his pleasures of escaping society (and the things it entails such as gossip, fights, etc.). He also reflects on his new companion, an old settler who arrives nearby and an old woman with great memory (&ldquo;memory runs back farther than mythology&rdquo;[7]). Thoreau repeatedly reflects on the benefits of nature and of his deep communion with it and states that the only &ldquo;medicine he needs is a draught of morning air.&rdquo;</p>
